# TD-simulation-test
This repository contains the scripts needed to run a time domain simulation using the LPV modeling method discussed in https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2021-67573

The script TDsimulation.py takes in the linear models, sets up the LPV scheme, and runs the simulation.

Please run these scripts in your weis environment, as you need pCrunch to load the OpenFAST simulation results stored in the '.outb' file.
